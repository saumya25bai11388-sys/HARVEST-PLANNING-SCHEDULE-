# HARVEST-PLANNING-SCHEDULE-
A harvest planning schedule is a timetable of crop readiness, labor use, equipment readiness, field status, and post-harvest procedures. It allows farmers to effectively plan resource allocation and prevent delays in losses, logistical coordination, and the proper timing of harvesting for optimal quality.
